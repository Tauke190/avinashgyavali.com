																● <b>Enhancing Spatial Cognition and Communication in Remote Collaboration </b>: I am working to improve how users understand and communicate about space during remote interactions, particularly in indoor environments like living rooms, kitchens, and offices. This involves encoding spatial information into language and using large language models (LLMs) to predict spatial intent based on social interactions. I'm addressing the challenge of LLMs' limited understanding of deictic expressions (such as pronouns and demonstratives).
															</p>
															<p>
																● <b>Fine-tuning LLMs for Spatial Deixis Detection</b> I'm fine-tuning LLMs to better detect and classify spatial deixis, which involves language references to locations relative to the speaker and listener. By generating synthetic datasets through processes like distillation from models like Llama 400B, my goal is to improve LLMs' ability to process spatial references and address their limitations in understanding pragmatic language.

															The university resolution platform aims to radically improve the way
															students and administrative departments at the university communicate and resolve
														 	student-related issues. Our vision is focused on developing a transparent, efficient,
															and easy-to-use web application that will function as a centralized point for
															tracking and resolving issues.
														</p>
														<ol>
															<li><b>Centralized Issue Tracking :</b> This platform will serve as a one-stop solution for all
																issue-related activities. It will log and track various student issues, 
																from academic concerns to administrative queries. This centralization ensures that no student
																query falls through the cracks and enables efficient monitoring.
															</li>
															<li>
																<b>Transparent Process: </b>Transparency is a core tenet of this platform. Students will be able to track the progress
																of their issues in real-time, understanding each step taken towards resolution.
																This clarity in process fosters trust and confidence in the university's administrative procedures.
														   </li>
														   	<li>
																<b>User-Friendly Interface: </b>Ease of use is paramount. The platform will be designed with a user-friendly interface,
																making it accessible for all students regardless of their tech proficiency. Simplifying the process of issue
																reporting and tracking enhance student engagement with the system.
															</li>

															<h4>Introduction</h4>
															<p>
																This paper discusses the design and development of a custom haptic syringe
																aimed to improve a virtual reality local anesthesia simulation (VRLA) that
																formally used a head mounted device (HMD) with hand controllers for haptics.
																A pilot study investigated the effectiveness of the custom haptic syringe to
																replace one of the hand controllers to provide a more realistic and better training experience.
															</p>
															<h4>Method</h4>
															<p>
																A one group pre-post survey investigated student perceptions regarding
																the effectiveness of a haptic syringe to provide a more realistic experience
																to train dental students to learn the procedural steps to inject local anesthesia
																into a virtual patient. Twenty-two third year dental students participated. 
																The pre-post survey examined changes in students’ perceived emotions, preparedness,
																and effectiveness of the VRLA as a foundational learning strategy prior to entering
																clinical group practice. 
															</p>
															<h4>Results</h4>
															<p>
																While quantitative results on comparable survey questions did not yield statistically
																significant differences, qualitative open-ended responses revealed a much greater
																satisfaction using the custom haptic syringe compared to the out of the box controllers.
															</p>
															<h4>Conclusions</h4>
															<p>
																Feedback regarding the haptic syringe showed a substantial step closer to providing a 
																more real experience for students in an effort to create a better bridge between 
																classroom learning and clinical practice in order to prepare students to more confidently 
																and competently work with real clients. Further refinement of the syringe is forthcoming 
																along with a more formal comparative experimental study.

															<h4>Abstract</h4>
															<p>
																A collaborative virtual environment (CVE) with a haptic interaction provides a medium for users
																to interact using tactile sensation and feel each other physical forces. Extensive research has
																shown that virtual collaborative interactions with haptic feedback show better performance in a 
																task than a virtual collaborative interaction with no-force feedback. Most of the research studies assume 
																that the human agent is in a bidirectional human-to-human collaborative task at the same skill level. 
																Humans have different skill levels and tactile responses to the same situations due to a combination of factors,
																including individual differences in sensory processing, motor control, cognitive abilities, experience, and
																learning Haptic interaction can only be useful in particular tasks. Most of the research studies use similar
																tasks like Cooperative Object Manipulation with similar levels of difficulty and complexity. This study aims
																to understand the haptic interaction between human agents in collaborative tasks of different complexity.
																The objective of this experiment is to also understand the force dynamics of human agents at different 
																levels of task complexity. Finally, the aim is to understand the relationship between dominant force and submissive
																force in a collaborative haptic environment.

																Traveling to the vibrant city of Chennai, I was eager to present my ongoing research on 
																AI-assisted remote collaboration in XR. My work addresses a fundamental challenge 
																in immersive VR meetings: how to provide a compelling incentive for users to adopt 
																these technologies over traditional platforms like Zoom. During the Q&A session,
																I asked Steve LaValle his thoughts on immersive VR meetings and their challenges. 
																His response was candid—even simple tasks like writing on a virtual whiteboard remain glitchy,
																and users lack compelling incentives to transition to VR.

															</p>
															<br>
															<p>
																This resonated deeply with my research goals. Immersive VR meetings offer 
																unique advantages, such as enabling the learning of psychomotor skills or 
																interacting with complex 3D information—capabilities that traditional 2D platforms
																cannot replicate. My research explores how AI and large language models can enhance
																these experiences. By activating visual cues such as gaze cues based on conversational
																data, we can implicitly reference positions in 3D space, making communication more intuitive.
																Ultimately, I aim to create context-aware, adaptive XR systems that capture and visualize cognitive processes
																such as communicative intent, attention, and emotions. These systems could significantly enhance user interaction
																and spatial cognition, making XR meetings viable and indispensable.

															</p>
															<br>

																I vividly recall my first encounter with Microsoft Hololens, playing Roboraid in my living room. This wasn't just any game; it was an extraordinary fusion of the physical and digital worlds. The game mechanics, requiring players to gaze and point at alien robots seemingly emerging from the walls, introduced me to a new dimension of gaming - Mixed Reality. The way Hololens mapped the room's walls and spawned enemies created an illusion so real it was mesmerizing. This experience inspired me to explore the world of Hololens app development.
															</p>
															<br>
															<p>
																The announcement of a Hololens hackathon at Khalifa University by Microsoft UAE was a golden opportunity I couldn't miss. Joined by enthusiastic teams from across the UAE, we embarked on a 48-hour quest to develop a groundbreaking application. Our team, humorously named "Space Devs," was ready for this exhilarating challenge.
															</p>
															<br>
															<p>
																After brainstorming, our vision was clear: to bring the experience of zero gravity to earth. We aimed to create an educational experience that lets users feel like astronauts, understanding the peculiar behavior of objects in zero gravity. Our project included a puzzle game for assembling a space rover, a fluid simulation that allowed users to interact with floating liquids, and a fire simulation demonstrating how flames become spherical without gravity. The finale was a demonstration of how gravity varies across planets, shown through the impact on a car when objects are dropped from different heights.
															</p>
															<br>
															<p>
																Developing our prototype was a test of endurance and creativity. I still remember the awe I felt interacting with the simulated fluid in zero gravity - it was surreal. Our final level, showcasing gravity's varying effects on different planets, was particularly satisfying, especially watching the devastation caused by Jupiter's intense gravity.As the hackathon neared its end, our presentation emphasized the potential of mixed reality in education. We advocated for how this technology could provide students with experiences that are nearly impossible to recreate in real life. The tension during the award announcement was palpable. When "Space Devs" was declared the winner, it was a moment of disbelief and joy. Standing on the stage, and receiving our awards, was not just a triumph but a validation of our hard work and creativity.
															</p>
															<br>
															<p>
																This hackathon was more than a competition; it was a journey of discovery, learning, and inspiration. It solidified my passion for XR (Extended Reality) and motivated me to delve deeper into this fascinating field. The experience taught me that mixed reality is not just about technology; it's about opening doors to new worlds and possibilities, transforming how we learn, experience, and understand our world.

																During my summer research, I worked at the intersection of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance communication in remote collaborative environments. The primary focus of my research was to explore how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to detect and interpret gaze cues from speech, aiming to improve the effectiveness of communication in virtual reality settings.
															</p>
															<br>
															<p>
																The objective of my research was to understand how natural conversation dynamics could be influenced by the integration of implicit gaze visualizations within a VR environment. By utilizing LLMs alongside shared gaze visualizations, we aimed to create more immersive interfaces that support seamless communication without relying on traditional methods such as detailed descriptive language, complex gestures, hand pointing, or sketching annotations. This approach holds the potential to significantly enhance collaboration by reducing the need for manual activation or rendering of communication cues, thereby streamlining the process of directing attention between remote users.
															</p>
															<br>
															<p>
																I was responsible for developing the entire software pipeline, from fine-tuning the LLM to suit our specific task, to developing a networked application using the Unity game engine. Initially, I applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as entity recognition systems, to detect deictic language in conversations. However, this approach did not fully capture the context of communication, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.

																To address this, I fine-tuned an LLM known as LLama-8B using parameter-efficient techniques like QLoRA. Due to the limited availability of datasets for detecting deictic language, the fine-tuned model was trained on a relatively small dataset and repurposed for binary classification. The model was trained to recognize phrases such as "Can you look at that?" or "Do you see that?" and subsequently activate visual cues to direct the attention of the other user.

																In addition, I developed a networked multiplayer application using Unity's Netcode, enabling users to create rooms, join sessions, and interact as virtual avatars with head and hand tracking. I integrated OpenAI's Whisper model to convert speech to text, allowing the LLM to process the conversation. Whisper's voice activity detection feature automatically paused transcription when no activity was detected, enhancing the system's efficiency.

																I chose the Oculus Quest Pro for its eye-tracking capabilities, enabling me to render a line from the user's eye to the object they were looking at. In the VR environment, if one user intended to direct another user's attention towards a specific object, the LLM would detect the deictic language used and activate the visual cue, effectively guiding the second user's focus.

																To improve the accuracy of LLM predictions, I implemented a sentence tokenizer, ensuring that only complete sentences were passed to the model for processing. This approach minimized errors that could arise from incomplete sentence analysis. Additionally, the LLM was deployed locally within the Unity game engine to eliminate latency issues associated with cloud-based processing.

																While the research is ongoing, with user studies yet to be conducted, our preliminary findings suggest that this integration of LLMs and gaze cues could facilitate more efficient and intuitive remote collaboration. By automating the transfer of communicative intent between users, we hope to enhance task efficiency and foster faster, more natural collaboration in mixed-reality environments.
